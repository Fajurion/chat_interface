# chat_interface

I'm making a chat app or something, this is a really big project. Even with voice chat and such and it's kinda something I wanted to create for a very long time. So now we're here. Yeah, this will hopefully be cool.

### Contributing

I don't currently look for contributors on this project that just make little changes. If you find a bug, please report it using an issue, but please don't make a pull request as I just don't have the time to look through all of this at this time. If you want to join the project as a developer and not just a contributor, please reach out to me on Discord or using an issue.
