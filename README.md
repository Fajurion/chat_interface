# chat_interface

I'm making a chat app or something, this is a really big project. Even with voice chat and such and it's kinda something I wanted to create for a very long time. So now we're here. Yeah, this will hopefully be cool.

### Contributing

If anyone reads this and wants to contribute (idk why you would want to), I don't really have any contribution guidelines or anything. So if you wanna contribute reach out to me on discord: @unbreathable and we'll talk about how we should handle this project or something if we get along well. I live in the EU so it would be good if your in a timezone that's not too far away from that.
